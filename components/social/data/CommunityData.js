          In collaboration with Green India Initiatives, Team Horizon
          distributed 200 solar lamps to students at GHPS Bilanakote school near
          our park in Dobbaspet, Karnataka. Coming from a rural community where
          reliable electricity is scarce, for these students, light is more than
          convenience—it’s opportunity, a bridge. A single lamp turns twilight
          into study time, missed lessons into brighter futures.
        </p>
        <p>
          This initiative reflects Horizon’s belief in sustainability with
          purpose: bringing renewable energy to those who need it most, reducing
          carbon footprints while expanding human potential. By illuminating
          young minds, we illuminate futures—and that is the light we are proud
          to stand for.

          In Malur, Karnataka, two schools, Masandra Government Lower Primary
          School & Huralagere Government High School, struggled with a hidden
          barrier to education - the absence of clean, hygienic toilets. For
          many students, especially girls, this meant absenteeism, discomfort,
          and even dropouts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Horizon addressed this by upgrading sanitation infrastructure with
          separate, well-maintained facilities for boys and girls. Beyond
          hygiene, these spaces restore safety, confidence, and focus -
          empowering students to learn without barriers and remain in school,
          creating the foundation for equal opportunity and brighter futures.,

          In collaboration with the CII Institute of Logistics, Horizon launched
          a Skill Development Center to train young people for careers in
          warehousing and logistics. Candidates are taught logistics processes,
          warehousing operations, industrial standards, and safety practices
          through a mix of classroom sessions and hands-on exposure.
        </p>
        <p>
          For many, the Skill Development Center is a bridge from learning to
          livelihood. Student beneficiaries have gained employment at ecommerce
          and quick commerce companies operating in our parks in NCR, reflecting
          its impact. By building a skilled workforce, the initiative supports
          occupiers’ needs while creating opportunities for local communities.

          To support World Environment Day 2023’s campaign
          #BeatPlasticPollution, Horizon partnered with 19 tenants in our NCR
          and Chakan parks to collect and recycle plastic waste. The waste was
          repurposed into durable, eco-friendly furniture for the Zilla Parishad
          School in Sadumbare, Chakan, and the Government Model Sanskriti
          Primary School in Palhawas, Rewari (Haryana).
        </p>
        <p>
          This initiative demonstrates how collective action can turn waste into
          value - reducing plastic footprint while creating tangible benefits
          for local communities. For us, sustainability is not a slogan but a
          practice: real measures, real outcomes, and a greener tomorrow.
